Most companies have some sort of list of products that are suitable for Vegans, however sometime they are quite hard to find. Below is a list of all of the ones I have been able to find. Hopefully this should make it easier for people (myself included).

**Companies that are yet to reply**:

- PepsiCo

- Warburtons
- Hovis
- Betty Crocker
- Dr Oetker
- Green And Blacks

**Companies who have confirmed that they do not have a vegan list**:

 - Morrisons
 - BirdsEye
 - Innocent Drinks (Because of the risk of contamination from the shellac in wax, they are not comfortable with saying products are vegan, some people may be fine with this)

More will be added as I find them. If you know of any, please let me know if the comments below.
