Most companies have some sort of list of products that are suitable for Vegans, however sometime they are quite hard to find. Below is a list of all of the ones I have been able to find. Hopefully this should make it easier for people (myself included).

**Companies who have confirmed that they do not have a vegan list**:

Company             | Notes
--------------------|-------
Betty Crocker       | "We would like to inform you that currently none of our Betty Crocker products are suitable for vegans as they may contain traces of milk or egg."
BirdsEye            |
Green And Blacks    | By definition vegan products contain no ingredients derived from animals within the recipe and this still remains true for Green & Black’s dark chocolate. However, as our dark chocolate is made on the same production line as our milk chocolate there is some risk of cross contact
Innocent Drinks     | Because of the risk of contamination from the shellac in wax, they are not comfortable with saying products are vegan, some people may be fine with this
Morrisons           |

More will be added as I find them. If you know of any, please let me know if the comments below.
